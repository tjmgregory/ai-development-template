<!-- How to use the project -->

## Development

This project follows the [Unified Process](docs/unified-process/README.md) methodology.

- **AI agents**: Read `AGENTS.md` at the start of each session
- **Process docs**: See `docs/unified-process/` for requirements, specifications, and project configuration

## Contributing

This project uses the [Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_process) and
[beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for development workflow.

### For AI Agents

Read `AGENTS.md` before starting work. It covers:

- The Unified Process and its phases
- How to use beads for issue tracking
- Where to find specs and requirements

### For Humans

1. Use `bd ready` to see available work (beads tracks all status/progress)
2. Claim issues with `bd update <id> --status in_progress` before starting
3. See `docs/unified-process/` for specs and requirements
4. Follow existing specs; update them if reality diverges

### Claude Code Users

`claude plugin install beads` - see [beads plugin](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/tree/main/claude-plugin)
